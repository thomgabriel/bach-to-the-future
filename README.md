# Bitmex Kollector
The ultimate data aggregator using Bitmex's Websocket - FATALITY ðŸ’‰ðŸ’€ðŸ—¡

<img src="img/cover.jpg" align="center" />

## Setup & usage

- pip3 install git+https://github.com/quan-digital/bitmex-kollector#egg=bitmex_kollector

- copy, config and run main.py :)

- data will be stored in settings.DATA_DIR ('data/' by default, change for deploy).

- status, instrument, candles and indicators will be stored on MongoDB Atlas.

- run on EC2 eu-west-1 (Ireland) because that's where Bitmex' Websocket is hosted.

- base Kollector will generate about 140MB of data a day, with more than half going towards 'instrument'. So estimate around 3GB of data a month, or 50GB a year. For bot operation, you can divide that by 60 at least.

### Left out topics

Left out due to low update frequency/importance. 

```bash
"announcement",        // Site announcements - low frequency & easily fetchable via rest
"connected",           // Statistics of connected users/bots - apparently discontinued
"insurance",           // Daily Insurance Fund updates - liquidation already gets it, continuous push overwrite 
"orders"               // Live updates on your orders - our bots already deals with orders via POST orders anyway, and generic order data is already fetched through the 'position' topic, continuous push overwrite
```
